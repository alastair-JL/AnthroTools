#' ComreySolve
#'
#' Given a square matrix, such that the matrix is the outer product of a single vector with itself (except for the diagonal, which is ignored), determine the vector that was originally used.
#' ComreySolve also has a helper function called ComreyIterate. There isn't really any reason why you would use Comrey iterate by itself.
#' @usage ComreySolve(M, precision = 0.005)
#' @aliases ComreySolve ComreyIterate
#' @param M A square matrix.
#' @param precision The level of error at which the process will stop iterating and return an answer. Error is measured as "change in output vector between two iteration steps."
#' @keywords Consensus
#' @export
#' @return A single vector of numbers representing the vector that was originally used to create M.
