\usage{
FreeListTable.freq(mydata, CODE = "CODE", Salience = "Salience", Subj = "Subj", subjNum, CODEnum)
}
\arguments{
\item{mydata}{Your data, as a data frame, with rows for each response gathered. For each response, you are expected to have the CODE, salience and Subj.}

\item{CODE}{The Column of "mydata" that the CODE of the response can be found in.}

\item{Salience}{The column of "mydata" that the calculated Salience is to be found in. Note that this will have been determined earlier using "CalculateSalience"}

\item{Subj}{The column of "mydata" in which the subject number can be found.}

\item{subjNum}{The subject number of interest.}

\item{CODEnum}{The code you desire information about.}
}
\value{
A number, representing either: The presence/absence of the given code in the individuals responses (if "presence" was used), the total number of times the code was given in response (for "freq") The total Salience of a given code (summed over all responses with that code) The Maximum Salience (effectively the Salience levels when the Code was first used) or the highest rank the code recieved for the given individual.
}
\description{
This is a collection of helper functions for the function \code{\link{FreeListTable}}, that determine the relationship between a particular subject, and a particular code. For example, FreeListTable.freq counts how often an individual has responded with the specified Code. They are not intended for individual use.
}
\note{
If you are using these functions directly yourself, something has probably gone wrong.
